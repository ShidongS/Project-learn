# Project-learn
This project is composed of 3 programs, which are twitter.py, google.py and link.sh. These programs indicate their function by their names, while some of the picture processing and video merging program lies in google.py and link.sh. The way to run this project is to launch the lin.sh in Linux and everything is done. This program would scan 50 tweets and download pictures for now. More functions are being added.
