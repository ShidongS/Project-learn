# Project-learn
The Twitter developer account is now finally ready after several days' trying.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By many many trials and modifications I finally managed to download pictures from twitter(gary1.py), although this edition is rather primary and may have some bugs in extreme conditions(like if this person has no tweets at all). I am trying to fix it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gary2.py solves the problem of having no tweet or pictures available problem. (I will keep gary1.py just as a document)
