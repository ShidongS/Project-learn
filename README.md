# Project-learn
This project is composed of 3 programs, which are twitter.py, google.py and link.sh. These programs indicate their function by their names, while some of the picture processing and video merging program lies in google.py and link.sh. This project only works in Linux. The way to run this project is to download all 3 files, open the terminal in the download path and type in './link.sh' and everything is done. This program would scan 50 tweets and download pictures for now. More functions are being added.


2018.9.18 update: now you can type in the acount name and select how many tweets to scan now. There are more updates including creating new folders to ensure that this project will work on everyone's computer as long as you have the key. Please use your own API key to run this project and don't forget to change the path of google key in link.sh.
